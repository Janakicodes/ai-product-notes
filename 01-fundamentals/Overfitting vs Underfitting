# Overfitting vs Underfitting

## Overfitting
Model memorizes training data but fails on new data.

## Underfitting
Model is too simple to capture patterns.

## User impact
- Overfitting: works for few users, fails for many
- Underfitting: inaccurate features, low trust

## PM considerations
- Monitor model performance continuously

**Example:**  
Irrelevant recommendations often indicate underfitting.
