# Supervised Learning

Learning from **labeled data** (input + correct answer).

**Example:**  
Spam detection using emails labeled “spam” or “not spam”.

## User impact
- Automatically filters spam
- Saves user time

## PM tip
- Label quality matters — inconsistent labels = poor UX

# Unsupervised Learning

Learns patterns **without labeled data**.

**Example:**  
User segmentation based on behavior.

## User impact
- Enables personalization without explicit inputs

## PM tip
- Great for insights
- Harder to measure accuracy

# Reinforcement Learning

Learns via **trial and error**, using rewards and penalties.

**Examples:**
- Game AI (Chess, Go)
- Recommendation systems optimizing engagement

## User impact
- Improves continuously
- Adapts to preferences over time

## PM tip
- Reward definition is critical
- Poor rewards can lead to harmful behavior
