# AI Basics: Data, Features, Models 

## 1. Data

**Data** is the raw material AI learns from.  
It can be numbers, text, images, audio, or video.

> Think of data as **fuel for the AI engine** — without it, AI cannot learn.

### User Impact
- **High-quality data** → accurate predictions → better UX
- **Poor or biased data** → wrong recommendations → frustration

**Examples**
- Spotify recommending songs you dislike → low engagement
- Google Photos tagging errors → user frustration

### PM Considerations
- Do we have **enough clean and relevant data**?
- Monitor for **bias, gaps, and outdated data**
- Ensure compliance with **privacy regulations**
  - GDPR
  - HIPAA (especially in healthcare)

**Example**
- AI in healthcare must strictly protect patient data

## 2. Features

**Features** are the inputs the model uses to make predictions.

**Examples**
- Churn prediction:
  - User activity
  - Session duration
  - Past purchases

### User Impact
- **Relevant features** → smarter predictions → personalization
- **Irrelevant features** → bad recommendations → poor UX

### PM Considerations
- Focus only on features that impact **user outcomes**
- Avoid feature bloat — more inputs ≠ better results

**Example**
- E-commerce recommendations should include:
  - Recent searches
  - Purchase history
  - Product ratings  
- Avoid unrelated or random data points

## 3. Model

The **model** is the trained AI system that predicts, classifies, or generates outputs.

> Think of the model as the **brain** built from data and features.

### User Impact
- Strong model → relevant and reliable outputs
- Weak model → incorrect results and bad UX

### PM Considerations
- Understand the **model type and limitations**
- Evaluate:
  - Accuracy
  - Fairness
  - Latency
  - Scalability

**Example**
- A chatbot using a small model may fail in long conversations → poor UX

## 4. Training vs Inference

### Training
- Teaching the model using historical data
- Expensive and time-consuming
- Happens **before** launch

### Inference
- Using the trained model to make predictions
- Happens **live** for users

### User Impact
- Users experience **inference**, not training
- Key concerns:
  - Speed
  - Accuracy
  - Relevance

### PM Considerations
- Ensure training data is **representative**
- Optimize inference for:
  - Low latency
  - Smooth UX

**Example**
- AI-powered search must respond in **< 1 second** to maintain engagement

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

Metrics measure how well the AI performs.

### Common Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- AUC

### User Impact Mapping
- Accuracy → correct recommendations
- Precision → fewer false positives
- Recall → fewer missed opportunities

### PM Considerations
- Don’t rely on accuracy alone
- Choose metrics aligned with **user value**

**Example**
- Fraud detection:
  - High **recall** is more important than perfect accuracy
  - Missing fraud is worse than flagging a few false cases

## Key PM Takeaway

> AI success = **Good Data + Right Features + Suitable Model + Correct Metrics**
